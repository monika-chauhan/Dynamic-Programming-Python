# In order to print the LIS, we maintain a separate array along with a dp array (say hash).
# Whenever we update our dp[i] value in the inner loop, we know that for index i, the previous index is prev_index.
# Therefore we simply store prev_index to hash[ i ]. In this way, we will have a way to trace back the LIS.
# Whenever we have computed the entire dp array and we find the maximum value in it. We store that maximum valueâ€™s index
# in a variable ( say last_index). Now with this last_index, and the hash array we can trace back the LIS elements.
# time = O(n*n)
# Space = O(n)
