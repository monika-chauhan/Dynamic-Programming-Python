# Algo
# So rather than storing the entire 2D Array of size N*4, we can just store values of size 4(say prev).
# We can then take a dummy array, again of size 4 (say temp) and calculate the next rowâ€™s value using the array we
# stored in step 1.
# After that whenever we move to the next day, the temp array becomes our prev for the next step.
# At last prev[3] will give us the answer.

# time = O(n*4*3)
# space = O(3)
