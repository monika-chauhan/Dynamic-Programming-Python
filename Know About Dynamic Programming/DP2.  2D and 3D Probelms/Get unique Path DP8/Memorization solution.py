# Given two values M and N, which represent a matrix[M][N]. We need to find the total unique paths from the top-left
# cell (matrix[0][0]) to the rightmost cell (matrix[M-1][N-1]).
# M = row , N = col

# We will be doing a top-down recursion, i.e we will move from the cell[M-1][N-1] and try to find our way to the
# cell[0][0]. Therefore at every index, we will try to move up and towards the left.

# Base case
# When i=0 and j=0, that is we have reached the destination so we can count the current path that is going on, hence we
# return 1.
# When i<0 and j<0, it means that we have crossed the boundary of the matrix and we couldnâ€™t find a right path, hence we
# return 0.

# time = O(n*m)
# Space = O(n*m)
